Задача 1. Создадим бэкэнд в S3 (необязательно, но крайне желательно).
Если в рамках предыдущего задания у вас уже есть аккаунт AWS, то давайте продолжим знакомство со взаимодействием терраформа и aws.

1. Создайте s3 бакет, iam роль и пользователя от которого будет работать терраформ. Можно создать отдельного пользователя, а можно использовать созданного в рамках предыдущего задания, просто добавьте ему необходимы права, как описано здесь.
2. Зарегистрируйте бэкэнд в терраформ проекте как описано по ссылке выше.


Задача 2. Инициализируем проект и создаем воркспейсы.

1. Выполните terraform init:
 - если был создан бэкэнд в S3, то терраформ создат файл стейтов в S3 и запись в таблице dynamodb.
 - иначе будет создан локальный файл со стейтами.
2. Создайте два воркспейса stage и prod.\
```
vlad@vepc:~/hw72/Terraform$ terraform workspace new stage
Created and switched to workspace "stage"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.
vlad@vepc:~/hw72/Terraform$ terraform workspace new  prod
Created and switched to workspace "prod"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.
```
3. В уже созданный aws_instance добавьте зависимость типа инстанса от вокспейса, что бы в разных ворскспейсах использовались разные instance_type.
```
locals {
  instance_type_map = {
    stage = "t3.micro"
    prod = "t3.large"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "ec2" {
  ami                    = data.aws_ami.ubuntu_server.id
  instance_type          = local.instance_type_map[terraform.workspace]
...

```
4. Добавим count. Для stage должен создаться один экземпляр ec2, а для prod два.
```
locals {
  dict_of_instance_count = {
      stage = 1
      prod = 2
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "ec2" {
  ami                    = data.aws_ami.ubuntu_server.id
  instance_type          = local.dict_of_instance_count[terraform.workspace]
  count = local.dict_of_instance_count[terraform.workspace]
```
5. Создайте рядом еще один aws_instance, но теперь определите их количество при помощи for_each, а не count.
```
locals {
  instances = {
      "t3.micro" = data.aws_ami.ubuntu_server.id
      "t3.large" = data.aws_ami.ubuntu_server.id
  }
}
resource "aws_instance" "ec2-2" {
  for_each = local.instances
  ami           = each.value
  instance_type = each.key
}
```

6. Что бы при изменении типа инстанса не возникло ситуации, когда не будет ни одного инстанса добавьте параметр жизненного 7. цикла create_before_destroy = true в один из рессурсов aws_instance.
```
lifecycle {
	create_before_destroy = true 
}
```


При желании поэкспериментируйте с другими параметрами и рессурсами.

В виде результата работы пришлите:

- Вывод команды terraform workspace list.
```
vlad@vepc:~/hw72/Terraform$ terraform  workspace  list
  default
* prod
  stage

vlad@vepc:~/hw72/Terraform$ terraform  workspace  list
```
- Вывод команды terraform plan для воркспейса prod.

```
vlad@vepc:~/hw72/Terraform$ terraform   plan 
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
